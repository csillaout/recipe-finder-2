Roast in the centre of the oven for 45 mins or until tender, with the lid on the side. Step 2 Meanwhile, rinse the wild rice well and cook following pack instructions, then spread out on a baking tray to cool. Thinly slice the fennel bulb and apple, then squeeze over \u00bd the lemon juice to stop them discolouring. Step 3 Heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, then, once the seeds begin to pop, stir in \u00bd the garlic and the fennel. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then mix through the apple, pecans and lemon zest. Remove from the heat. Add the mixture to the the cooked rice, then stir in the chopped parsley and taste for seasoning. Step 4 Pack the mixture into the cooked pumpkin and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until everything is piping hot. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining lemon juice with the tahini, the rest of the garlic and enough water to make a dressing. Serve the pumpkin in the middle of the table, topped with pomegranate seeds and the dressing.",

Score a 1cm border. Prick the centre area with a fork and put in the oven for 12 mins with the carrots. Step 3 Fry the shallot in butter until totally soft, then stir through the mushrooms. Fry for several mins until mushrooms are tender and the mixture is dry. Spread out on a plate to cool. Whizz a third of the mushroom mixture with the nuts, cream cheese, tarragon and seasoning, so you have a coarse texture. Tip into a bowl and stir through the remaining mushroom mix. Step 4 Remove the pastry base from the oven and gently press down the centre area with the back of a spoon. Spread the mushroom mix inside and lay the glazed carrots on top. You may need to tuck the ends round to fit the carrots in. Drizzle over the remaining maple syrup and bake for a further 12-15 mins until the pastry is golden. Sprinkle with a few tarragon leaves and some more chopped nuts to serve.",

Take the cauliflower and remove the outer leaves and the base of the stalk so that it sits flat in a large roasting tin. Rub the spiced yogurt mixture all over it then pour 100ml water into the roasting tin around the base of the cauliflower. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 45 mins. Step 2 Meanwhile, put the tahini in a bowl and slowly add the lemon juice, stirring constantly, to make a smooth sauce \u2013 it should be the consistency of single cream. Chill until needed. Step 3 When the cauliflower has roasted, remove the foil and return to the oven for a further 10-15 mins. Put the chickpeas in a saucepan with 50ml water and cook over a medium heat until piping hot. Season, then crush with a potato masher \u2013 you want some to be smooth and others to be just a little broken. Stir in 1 tsp of the tahini sauce. Step 4 Take the cauliflower out of the oven and put the pitta bread in to warm for 2-3 mins while you cut the cauliflower into 8 wedges. Step 5 To serve, place a warmed pitta bread on each plate, top with the crushed chickpeas followed by the cauliflower wedges. Drizzle with the remaining tahini sauce and sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds, sunflower seeds and herbs. Serve warm or cold.

Peel and halve the shallots, then set aside. Put the sugar in a 23cm ovenproof frying pan and heat until it dissolves and you have a sticky caramel. Add the butter, thyme and a splash of balsamic vinegar or cracked black pepper. Take care as it will spit. Step 2 Remove the pan from the heat and put all the shallots into the pan, cut-side down. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and cut out a round 2cm larger than the pan. Drape the pastry over the shallots and tuck in the edges, so that it hugs the shallots. Place the pan in the oven and cook for 25-30 mins until the pastry is puffed up and golden. Leave to rest for 1 min, then invert the tart onto a plate. Serve with a punchy salad of rocket and goats cheese.",
